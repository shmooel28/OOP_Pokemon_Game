About the mission
--

Classes
--
to learn about the classes visit in wiki page https://github.com/shmooel28/OOP_Pokemon_Game/wiki/Classes

Algorithm
--
My Algorithm is a greedy algo, for every agent check for every pokemon that not allocat an agent, the sum of the pokemon value less the distance from the agent*10
then take the max sum and allocat the pokemon for the agent.
for saving in "move" acction, and yet not missing a pokemon, i check if their is an agent close to pokemon, if you have agent like this call move, else only call move 8.4 time in a seconde.

Requirements
--
java machine (JDK 11 or above)
python
install pygame
import json


Example
--
in the GUI you can see that have a stop button, and print the time left, grade and moves.
you can see you have to type of pokemon, one for pokemon type negative and one for type positive
The type is determined by the start and the end of the Pokemon sit on, if the start point lower than the end point, than the type is positive, else is negative
